# ImageQualityFunctions
## Description
This project is created in order to measure quality metrics by quality functions. They cover different quality sides:
- noise;
- blurriness;
- unvisible artifacts;
- over- and under- illumination.
may be something more. 

Since the algorithms are gonna be used on kinda selfie-images, sometimes cases can be specific (for example for illumination).
Descriptions of the algorithms can be found in the subfolders.

The following points are tried to be covered:
- Algorithms should be fast;
- The latency should be almost indepent on image size;
- ?.
